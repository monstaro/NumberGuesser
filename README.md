## How To Play

1) We first need to select our range by entering a minimum and maximum in boxes 1 and 2 respectively. Once you have set a min and max, hit the update button in box 3 on the right. The numbers in box 4 will update to show the current range and a random number will be generated between these two values.

The project turned out to have its fair share of ups and downs. Some things were accomplished easily, some things took a couple of days to figure out. Most of the issues were based in syntax, git confusion, and things along those lines. 

We struggled most with functionality on the dynamic boxes on the right side of the site. It took getting help from some outside resources to finally get it, and we still faced challenges trying to get the boxes to stack, as well as getting the boxes to close. Some minor functionality issues on the input boxes (ex. if we enter a number like 500 in our min range box but have nothing in the max range, it doesn't give an error)
