### How To Play

1) We first need to select our range by entering a minimum and maximum in boxes 1 and 2 respectively. Once you have set a min and max, hit the update button in box 3 on the right. The numbers in box 4 will update to show the current range and a random number will be generated between these two values. If no value is enetered, the text will default to a min of 1 and max of 100. If your minimum value is larger than your maximum and error will be displayed.

2) We can now choose our names and guesses by enetering each players info in boxes 1 and 2. To submit your guesses, click submit in box 3. To generate a new random number you can either click reset in box 4 (which will generate a new number between the two values given in step one) or you can redo step one to also change the min and max values. If you'd like to start over with new names and guesses you can click the clear button in box 5.

3) Once you have submitted your names and guesses the section at the bottom will display both for each player and give you a hint of "That's too high" or "That's too low" in relation to the random number we are trying to guess.

4) If you have won the hint text will display "BOOM!" and a card will pop up on the right side shwoing the names of both challengers and the name of the winner. The number of guesses it took to win the game will also be displayed at the bottom of the card. If the game has been cleared, reset, or if the min and max values have been updated the number of guesses will be reset.
