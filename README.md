# NumberGuesser
Cam and Cody


We are building a number guessing game.

**Day 1** - we drafted a HTML skeleton and added CSS styling. That part is about halfway complete. 
***Goals:*** Fix display positioning in boxes. Set Range box needs the labels to go above the boxes, while the boxes display inline.

For some reason the buttons in the mid-left box look a different shape than the button in the top-left box, even though they have the same class.

General formatting for the rest of the boxes.

The project turned out to have its fair share of ups and downs. Some things were accomplished easily, some things took a couple of days to figure out. Most of the issues were based in syntax, git confusion, and things along those lines. 

We struggled most with functionality on the dynamic boxes on the right side of the site. It took getting help from some outside resources to finally get it, and we still faced challenges trying to get the boxes to stack, as well as getting the boxes to close. Some minor functionality issues on the input boxes (ex. if we enter a number like 500 in our min range box but have nothing in the max range, it doesn't give an error)
