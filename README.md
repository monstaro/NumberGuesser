# NumberGuesser
Cam and Cody


We are building a number guessing game.

**Day 1** - we drafted a HTML skeleton and added CSS styling. That part is about halfway complete. 
***Goals:*** Fix display positioning in boxes. Set Range box needs the labels to go above the boxes, while the boxes display inline.

For some reason the buttons in the mid-left box look a different shape than the button in the top-left box, even though they have the same class.

General formatting for the rest of the boxes.
